Synergy of CNN with Random Forest based hybrid architecture to estimate the quality of Coherent optical communication

In this project, a hybrid approach was used by combining CNN and Random Forest regressor to estimate the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) parameter accurately.
EVM plays a crucial role in monitoring the signal quality to determine the performance of coherent optical communications.
